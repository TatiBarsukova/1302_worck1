    <div>Cars are an essential part of many people’s lives nowadays.

        Since their appearance many <span class="select2">have changed.</span>
        Travelling from one place to another became easier and faster.

        <span class="select1">Besides when we go by car, comfort during the trip is guaranteed.</span> There are many
        types of
        cars: small, large,
        cargo сars, minivans, <span class="select3">jeeps.</span> All of them are multifunctional. First and the most
        important role of the car
        is driving to work and back. Many people in big cities live in the suburbs but work in the downtown. That’s
        why every morning and evening people use personal cars. When the road traffic is heavy they can use public
        transport.

    <div>
        <span class="select4">Second role </span> of the car is to travel to long distances, for instance, to other
        cities or countries. There
        are, of
        course, other ways of travelling: by bus, by train, by plane. However, only cars let us feel comfortable
        and
        free on the way. Many people choose cars because of the beautiful view from the window. The only
        disadvantage of
        distant travels by car is the price of gasoline. In many countries it’s usually high.
